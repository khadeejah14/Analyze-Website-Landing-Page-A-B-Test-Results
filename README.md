#  Introduction
This project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
# Part I - Probability
The probablity users converted in both control and treatment group are similar to each other
therefore, there is no evidence that new page leads to more conversions.
# Part II - A/B Test
*we can not reject the null hypothesis beacuse the  value of z-score = 1.3109 does not exceed the critical value of 1.96.
# Part III - Regression
The result show there is no effect of the page and country on converted rate
